# libdasm

libdasm is a C-library that tries to provide simple and convenient
way to disassemble Intel x86 raw op-code bytes (machine code).
It can parse and print out op-codes in AT&T and Intel syntax.

The op-codes are based on IA-32 Intel Architecture Software Developer's
Manual Volume 2: Instruction Set Reference, order number 243667,
year 2004.  Non-Intel instructions are not supported at the moment (also,
non-Intel but Intel-compatible CPU extensions, like AMD 3DNow! are
not supported).
